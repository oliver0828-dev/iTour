## Why Am I learning Swift Data?
This is my step to using a data model provided by Apple. I haven’t tried using CoreData, and after SwiftData’s introduction in WWDC 2022, I have watched demos and usage, but never got a chance to use it. Currently, with my project — Cluber — I am planning on to adhere SwiftData for Lunch Club models, and After-School Activities models.
